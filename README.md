# path-search-algorithms-python
Different path search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*) on a 20x20 squared grid in Python
# Note: 
- Still not optimized because i didn't handle the case when there are too much walls at ending point
- For a larger grid, Dijkstra and A* seem taking much more time than BFS and DFS
# Run
```
python visualize.py
```

# Result
